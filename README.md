### How to Create an App in Spotify and Get Client ID and Secret

1. **Log in to the Spotify Developer Dashboard**
   - Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login).
   - Log in with your Spotify account. If you don't have an account, you'll need to create one.

2. **Create a New App**
   - Once logged in, click on the "Create an App" button.
   - Fill in the details for your new app:
     - **App Name**: Choose a name for your app.
     - **App Description**: Provide a brief description of your app.
     - **Redirect URI**: Add the URI where users will be redirected after authorization ( `http://localhost:8000/auth/callback` for local development).
   - Accept the Spotify Developer Terms of Service.
   - Click on the "Create" button.

3. **Retrieve Client ID and Client Secret**
   - After creating the app, you will be redirected to the app's dashboard.
   - Here you will find your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Copy these values as you will need them for authorization.

### Linking Your Project to Firebase with `serviceAccount.js`

#### 1. Set Up Firebase Project

1. **Create a Firebase Project**
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Click on "Add project" and follow the prompts to create a new Firebase project.

2. **Generate a Service Account Key**
   - In the Firebase Console, navigate to your project.
   - Click on the gear icon next to "Project Overview" and select "Project settings".
   - Go to the "Service accounts" tab.
   - Click on "Generate new private key" and confirm by clicking "Generate key". This will download a JSON file containing your service account credentials.

#### 2. Create `serviceAccount.json`

1. **Create a New File**
   - In your project directory, create a new file named `serviceAccount.json`.

2. **Add the Service Account Credentials**
   - Copy the content of the downloaded JSON file and paste it into `serviceAccount.json`.
   - Export the credentials as a module. Your `serviceAccount.json` should look like this:

   ```javascript
   const serviceAccount = {
     "type": "service_account",
     "project_id": "your-project-id",
     "private_key_id": "your-private-key-id",
     "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR-PRIVATE-KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
     "client_email": "your-client-email@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
     "client_id": "your-client-id",
     "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
     "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
   }


## Usage

Once everything is setup `cd` to the project folder. In order to start the frontend server.

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Then to start the backend server go back to parent directory and then.

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

## How to Extend the Project

### Backend
- Create a file in the backend/api folder using `template.js`.
- Import a the new route in `app.js` and use the pre-established format to add the route.
- Implement the API endpoint for this route. Depending on the purpose of the endpoint you may need to verify that the Spotify token which the user has provided is still valid using appropriate error handling on the frontend. In order to make the API as flexible as possible try to send raw data to the frontend unless the data processing is compute intensive.

### Frontend:
- In `Sidebar.jsx` add the link and an appropriate icon to the `LinkItems` array.
- Create a new route in the router in `main.jsx` under the children of `App.jsx`. This will allow `react-router-dom` to recognize the page.
- Add a component file in `Routes.jsx`. This will be the component you define in `Main.jsx`.Â 
- Import/create necessary components and subscribe to the AuthContext if you need to make any calls to API endpoints that interface with the Spotify API.

The Firebase initialization is handled in the `firebase.js` file, which sets up the connection to the Firestore database using the service account credentials.

### Example Usage

To use the API, ensure that you have the necessary environment variables set up, including `CLIENT_ID`, `SECRET_ID`, and Firebase service account credentials in a file in the root of the backend directory called `serviceAccount.json`. Start the server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will run on the specified port (default is 8000). You can then make requests to the endpoints as described above.
